erified PurchaseI liked this better than the Pro version of One Plus 7. The popup camera is really fancy in One Plus 7 Pro but the camera is better in One plus 7.OnePlus 7 is the most balanced phone you will probably hold in your hands this year. It's got a design that works with some minor touch-ups, a great viewing experience, sheer power under the hood and decent pair of cameras that won't let you miss any moment. On combining these elements with OxygenOS optimizations.I liked the design the performance is top-notch just like any other One plus phone. This is beast in terms of everything. This is a true Flagship phone.Loved it.
